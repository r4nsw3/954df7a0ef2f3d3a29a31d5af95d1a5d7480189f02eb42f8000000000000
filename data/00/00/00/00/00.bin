  |   The concept of this title, the latest in the series to depict a new   |
  |   "Atelier" world, is "True-to-life youths that develop together,       |
  |   even if just a little bit".                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It is the story of a girl and her friends who are about to become     |
  |   adults, discovering what is most important to them.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   To depict the story of the main characters discovering things         |
  |   they've never seen before, we've created fields with natural          |
  |   shadows that allow you to feel the breath of the world. Graphics      |
  |   have been further enhanced, allowing for a world of daily-life and    |
  |   adventure to be depicted in a new way.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Main points.                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The "Synthesis" system in which players combine materials to create   |
  |   items has been revamped.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Now, in addition to being able to understand the effects of           |
  |   synthesis visually, the system allows you to enjoy the experience     |
  |   of developing recipes more than ever before.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Also, we've included "Location Points" that players can create        |
  |   through synthesis!                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   When "Gathering" the necessary materials for synthesis, the items     |
  |   you receive change depending on the tools you use to gather them,     |
  |   so it will be easier to obtain the items you want.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With a combination of turn-based command battle and real time         |
  |   elements, enjoy intense battles where the choices you make            |
  |   determine the outcome! It is a system that will allow you to sense    |
  |   the feeling of strengthening bonds with your friends more than        |
  |   ever.                                                                 |

  |                                                                         |
  |   Tired of boring village life, she escapes the village to gather       |

  |   and plan thrilling adventures.                                        |
